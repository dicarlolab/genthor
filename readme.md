Genthor is about integrating generative models and Bayesian techniques 
with thor.


Setting up your environment:
You need to add/export to your environment the variable GENTHOR_PATH,
which points to the base of your genthor directory. i.e.:

export GENTHOR_PATH="/home/<username>/work/genthor"

Also, you need to make sure python can see it -- either by using
distutils or by appending GENTHOR_PATH to your PYTHONPATH.
