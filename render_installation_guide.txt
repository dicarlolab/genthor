Preliminary:

-Install the following packages:

# % you must have root to install these packages (if you are on mh_17 they are already installed)

apt-get install bison flex

apt-get install -y -q libgl1-mesa-dev

apt-get install -y -q libtiff4-dev

apt-get install -y -q libsdl1.2-dev



-Copy this obj_Bscript.py in genthor to your ~/.skdata/genthor directory:

cp [PATHTOGENTHOR]/genthor/genthor/modeltools/obj_Bscript.py ~/.skdata/genthor   (make ~/.skdata/genthor if it doesn't exist)



Blender

-Download, extract and install prebuilt blender from website.

http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender/
Choose the right operation system and copy the downloading link
Use wget to install in shell
If installing on mh17 (linux 64), the link is http://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.68/blender-2.68a-linux-glibc211-x86_64.tar.bz2

-Rewrite so that you are installing to a specific directory (let's use ~/renderer) 
To install blender, first make a new folder called 'render' in HOME directory: mkdir render
Then, unzip using the proper tar command based on file type: tar jxf filename.tar.bz2
It doesn't matter where you unzip panda.

-Copy the modified folders io_scene_egg and io_scene_obj reader plugin from Blender's addons to the directory containing genthor.
# all paths are absolute
# [PATH_TO_GENTHOR] means the folder that contains the genthor module, setup.py, etc (This is the "genthor install" directory, where you cloned the genthor repo into from github.)

cp -r ~/[PATHTOGENTHOR] ~/[PATHTOBLENDERINSTALL]/2.68/scripts/addons/io_scene_egg 
For example: cp -r ~/genthor/io_scene_obj ~/render/blender-2.68a-linux-glibc211-x86_64/2.68/scripts/addons/ 

cp -r ~/[PATHTOGENTHOR] ~/[PATHTOBLENDERINSTALL]/2.68/scripts/addons/io_scene_obj 

Then link /bin/blender to your install location:

ln -s ~/PATHTOBLENDERINSTALL/blender ~/bin/blender
For example: ln -s ~/render/blender-2.68a-linux-glibc211-x86_64/blender ~/bin/blender


Panda

-Download panda from source.
# wget url
https://www.panda3d.org/download/panda3d-1.8.1/panda3d-1.8.1.tar.gz 

-Unzip using tar -zxvf filename.tar.gz

-Make using
# make sure you are in the folder where you installed/extracted panda before you run makepanda
python makepanda/makepanda.py --everything --no-vision

You can then install it in the same location (path to install has to be the same as path you called makepanda)

python makepanda/installpanda.py --prefix=/[PATHYOUWANTTOINSTALLIN]

-Edit panda's Config.prc file (locate or find Config.prc, nano or vi the file) so it looks like this 

#load-display pandagl
#load-display pandadx9
#load-display pandadx8
#load-display pandagles
load-display p3tinydisplay

Note: The point of making this change is to allow panda to render to an off-screen buffer, so that it can run on machines 
without displays (e.g. servers). This is an installation-specific thing that, if you were running on your own personal 
desktop and wanted to see things on the screen as they rendered, you could leave it as it was (e.g. pandagl).


Set sys path of Panda

-add [PATH_TO_PANDA_INSTALL]/usr/local/share/panda3d and [PATH_TO_PANDA_INSTALL]/usr/local/share/panda3d to your python path using

export PYTHON_PATH='~/panda3d-1.8.1/usr/local/lib/panda3d':'~/panda3d-1.8.1/usr/local/share/panda3d'

-then add this line to your .profile so this is done automatically at login


In ipython
-import genthor.datasets as gd
# When you run genthor for the first time, it will need to load background and models. 
# You can do this by:
meta=dataset.meta
# after define your models, you will need to load models
dataset.get_models()
